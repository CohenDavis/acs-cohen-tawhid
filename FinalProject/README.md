ACS Final Project: In-Memory Key-Value Store Implementation

# Brief Description
Per the professor's suggestion, the team will implement an in-memory key-value store system, leveraging either B-trees or hash tables for indexing. The implementation will at minimum support GET, PUT, and DELETE operations, as well as concurrency control.
